Overview
========

ChemTorch is organized into three main packages:

- **components**: Modular building blocks (data pipeline, representations, transforms, models, layers)
- **core**: PyTorch Lightning modules (DataModule, Routine, Trainer integration)
- **utils**: Helper functions and utilities

All public APIs follow consistent patterns and are designed for composability.
