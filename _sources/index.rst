Welcome to ChemTorch!
=====================

ChemTorch is a modular open-source research framework for deep learning of chemical reactions.

- 🚀 **Streamline your research workflow**: seamlessly assemble modular deep learning pipelines, track experiments, conduct hyperparameter sweeps, and run benchmarks.
- 💡 **Multiple reaction representations** with baseline implementations including SMILES tokenizations, molecular graphs, 3D geometries, and fingerprint descriptors.
- ⚙️ **Preconfigured data pipelines** for common benchmark datasets including RDB7, cycloadditions, USPTO-1k, and more.
- 🔬 **OOD evaluation** via chemically informed data splitters (size, target, scaffold, reaction core, ...).
- 🗂️ **Extensible component library** (growing) for all parts of the ChemTorch pipeline.
- 🔄 **Reproducibility by design** with Weights & Biases experiment tracking and a guide for setting up reproducibility tests.
